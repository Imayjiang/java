IO的环节中，我们需要先理解几个概念：
1.asynchronous:
2.synchronous:
3.blocking:     simply it means the process turn to be waiting
4.non-blocking:

A synchronous I/O operation causes the requesting process to be blocked until
that  I/O operation completes;
An asynchronous I/O operation does not cause the requesting process to be blocked;


I/O models(core concept:用户空间和用户进程、内核空间和内核进程)
•blocking I/O: blocked all the way

•non-blocking I/O: if no data in buffer, immediate returns EWOULDBLOCK

•I/O multiplexing (select and poll): blocked separately in wait and copy

•signal driven I/O (SIGIO): non-blocked in wait but blocked in copy
 (signaled when I/O can be initiated)

•asynchronous I/O (aio_): non-blocked all the way
 (signaled when I/O is complete)
